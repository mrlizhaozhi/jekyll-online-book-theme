<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

I'm committed to making this website accessible to the widest possible audience. I'm continuing the effort to modernise the website to add more accessibility features. 

The website uses media queries and CSS styles to achieve accessibility. It incorporates responsive and mobile-first design principles as well as other proven user experience design standards. The website is responsive to media screen sizes, meaning that it should be accessible across multiple devices from desktops to tablets to mobiles. A web browser is all you need to visit the content on this website.

The website supports the latest version of mainstream browsers including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Opera and Internet Explorer.

Jekyll is the engine behind this website. Jekyll is an open-source static site generator from GitHub that converts static markdown (.md) files into HTML web pages based on custom template designs, making it easy for developers to maintain the website.
