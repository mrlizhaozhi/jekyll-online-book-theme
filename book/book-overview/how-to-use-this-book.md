This is a textbook, not an academic paper, not a news article, and not a fiction, etc. This book teaches you how Python can be used for data analysis. It's a practical skill. And, to learn anything practical, practice is essential. This guide will help you make the most out of this book.

Before we start, let's double check if you meet the following criteria to make the most out of this book just in case you skipped the Foreword section (I'd strongly recommend you reading the Foreword. Every page is there for a reason in this book!):

<div style="padding-left: 50px; font-family: 'Open Sans';">
    1) You're not experienced in Python and programming in general;
    <br>
    2) You want to acquire Python programming skills to tackle data puzzles.
</div>

If you meet these criteria, congratulations! You will make the most out of this book. If not, you should pause here and look for other resources. I'm serious. I feel a sense of responsibility to serve my readers well with my writing. This book isn't written for me, it's for you!

Now, for those of you who passed the first check, let's look into the details of how you can make the most out of this book. There're a number of rules that you should follow.

#1. If you want to make the most out of a book, you need to fully utilise everything the book offers.

It's that simple. This is rule number one. If you want to get the most out of this book, you should make use of every resource that this book provides. If you constantly skip pages or choose not to engage the material, then you won't be able to make the most out of this learning experience. Engagement means reading through the texts, charts, and examples with patience AND getting your hands dirty to participate in the programming exercises.

Programming is a practical skill -- you don't do it, you won't get it. Period. To make the most out of each page, you need to slow down, treat the texts with the same level of respect as you treat the charts and code. I know reading isn't fun for everyone, but it is the best way to learn. Trust me: every word, phrase and sentence exists for a reason in my book. It's harder to write than read. If I put in the effort to write down the knowledge for you, you should consider the texts of high importance; otherwise, they won't be presented to you. How much you can learn from this book hinges on how much effort you're willing to put into it.
