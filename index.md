Written by Li Zhaozhi, a tenured business analyst in the banking industry with a strong academic background in computer science, <i>Python Essentials for Data Science</i> uses plain language to introduce aspiring analysts to the world of scientific programming with Python. 

Unlike other beginner-level Python and data science books, this book makes no assumption on readers' background. It's specifically written for those with limited to no exposure to computer programming and data science to quickly grasp the essentials to get started on their first data science projects. It is ideal for those who want to learn Python <i>for</i> meeting data analytics challenges.

The examples and exercises in this book are tailor-made for this group of audience, enabling learners to acquire knowledge and immediately see the value of their newly acquired skills.
