<h1>Foreword</h1>

<p>This book is about using Python for data science - organising data, manipulating data, analysing data and building data visualisations. I know thereâ€™re many books out there on this topic, but this book is different from those in a number of ways.</p>

<p>First, this book is written for beginners - beginners in Python programming and in data science. Whilst thereâ€™re many books teaching readers how to use Python to analyse data, even books that claim to be written for absolute beginners assume readers have some programming knowledge before diving into data science. This assumption is frustrating because most data scientists do not intend to write code full-day. Theyâ€™re data but not computer scientists. People end up reading another thick book on Python basics before they can comprehend data science books. It doesnâ€™t have to be this way. It is more reasonable to assume that those whoâ€™re only interested in using programming to make sense of data would want resources that comprehensively cover both the technical ins and outs as well as applications in data science.</p>

<p>Second, as a book dedicated to beginners in data science, the exercises in this book are tailored to fit aspiring data scientistsâ€™ interests. Those whoâ€™re interested in data science would seek every opportunity to learn something new about data. They donâ€™t want to build computer games or websites. Theyâ€™d be more intrigued by statistics, data frames and charts rather than general software engineering. This book provides examples, exercises and projects based on real-world data, enabling students to see immediately how their newly acquired Python skills can come in handy in data analysis.</p>

<p>Third, because of the aforementioned features, this is a very focused book. Thereâ€™re publishers and authors out there claiming that their books are useful for all audiences regardless of their experience and interests. Books with this marketing line rarely fulfil their promises. Rather than writing a generic book, I want to make it clear: This book is for programming beginners whoâ€™re looking to solve data science problems. If you a) lack Python experience but b) want to meet data challenges, you should read this book. If not, other books would meet your expectation better.</p>

<p>I hope that those of you who put trust in this book would find at least something practical from the pages. This book is a <i>work in progress</i>. Itâ€™s incomplete, and I will continue to edit existing pages and add fresh content. Once all these edits are done, a nice formatted PDF version will be provided on this website. Please check this book regularly for updates.</p>
