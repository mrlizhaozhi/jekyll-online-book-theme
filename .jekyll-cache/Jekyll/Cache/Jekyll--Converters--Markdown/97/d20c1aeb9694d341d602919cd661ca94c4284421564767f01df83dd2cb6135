I"><h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>This is a textbook - a textbook with examples and hands-on exercises. The overarching goal of this book is to introduce students to the Python programming language and how it can be used in data analysis. The content therin is tailored to reach this objective.</p>

<p>This book is segregated into three modules: 1) Python basics, 2) data science and 3) projects. These modules are sequential; therefore, students are expected to study these modules in the designed order following the table of contents.</p>

<p>The Python basics module introduces students to the Python programming language. They will get to know the basics such as data types, data structures, variables, functions, classes and other essentials in Python programming. Examples and exercises are based on data analysis challenges. Students will learn to use Python to analyse data as they get to know the language.</p>

<p>The data science module introduces students to some of the most commonly used Python libraries for data science such as NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib. Machine learning frameworks and libraries such as TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn are out of the scope of this introductory textbook.</p>

<p>Finally, the projects module provides hands-on opportunities for students to apply programming in meeting data challenges. These projects include data cleansing, data analysis, data visualisation, and everything taught in the previous modules.</p>

<p>In total, the book consists of 15 chapters. Students can refer to the table of contents for more details on the structure of this book.</p>
