I"Å	<h1>How to Use This Book</h1>

<p>This is a textbook, not an academic paper, not a news article, and not a fiction, etc. This book teaches you how Python can be used for data analysis. It‚Äôs a practical skill. And, to learn anything practical, practice is essential. This guide will help you make the most out of this book.</p>

<p>Before we start, let‚Äôs double check if you meet the following criteria to make the most out of this book just in case you skipped the Foreword section (I‚Äôd strongly recommend you reading the Foreword. Every page is there for a reason in this book!):</p>

<div style="padding-left: 50px; font-family: 'Open Sans';">
    1) You're not experienced in Python and programming in general;
    <br />
    2) You want to acquire Python programming skills to tackle data puzzles.
</div>

<p>If you meet these criteria, congratulations! You will make the most out of this book. If not, you should pause here and look for other resources. I‚Äôm serious. I feel a sense of responsibility to serve my readers well with my writing. This book isn‚Äôt written for me, it‚Äôs for you!</p>

<p>Now, for those of you who passed the first check, let‚Äôs look into the details of how you can make the most out of this book. There‚Äôre a number of rules that you should follow.</p>

<p>#1. If you want to make the most out of a book, you need to fully utilise everything the book offers.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs that simple. This is rule number one. If you want to get the most out of this book, you should make use of every resource that this book provides. If you constantly skip pages or choose not to engage the material, then you won‚Äôt be able to make the most out of this learning experience. Engagement means reading through the texts, charts, and examples with patience AND getting your hands dirty to participate in the programming exercises.</p>

<p>Programming is a practical skill ‚Äì you don‚Äôt do it, you won‚Äôt get it. Period. To make the most out of each page, you need to slow down, treat the texts with the same level of respect as you treat the charts and code. I know reading isn‚Äôt fun for everyone, but it is the best way to learn. Trust me: every word, phrase and sentence exists for a reason in my book. It‚Äôs harder to write than read. If I put in the effort to write down the knowledge for you, you should consider the texts of high importance; otherwise, they won‚Äôt be presented to you.</p>
